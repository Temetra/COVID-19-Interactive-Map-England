# Interactive map of Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in England

## About

This website combines [UTLA cases table data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-track-coronavirus-cases) with [Counties and Unitary Authorities boundary data](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/counties-and-unitary-authorities-april-2019-boundaries-ew-buc).

Case counts might be low or non-existant depending on the current government policy. Current guidance states ["We will not be testing people who are self-isolating with mild symptoms"](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public).

## Technology

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) provides the SPA framework, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is used for CSS, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) handles mapping, and the application is compiled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).
